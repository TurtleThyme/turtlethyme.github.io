title: The Big O Notation
---

The Big O Notation is a term that is used to define how long an algorithm takes. This is used to find the worst case scenario of an alogorithm. The more squares or the more bigger the Big O Notation gets, the longer the algorithm takes.

O(1) is the fastest time as it takes only 1 calculation for a constant.

The Square root of O which is O(âˆšN) or logorithm is also really fast as it takes the square root amount of times to get to the asnwer. 

Linear O which is just O(N) takes longer when there is a bigger N so it gradually gets slower.

Then there is the powers which are super slow whcih takes O(N^2) or more. This very slow and takes N Squared the amount of times to get to the answer which means this strategy gets exponetially times slower when N gets larger. 

The Big O Notation when you think about it is just like y = mx. The m and x can change and more parameters can be added. The more bigger y gets, the more slow the algorithm is. Usually you would want to look at the algorithm over bigger periods of N so we can see how fast the algorithm is when handling bigger values of N.
