title: The Big O Notation
---

The Big O Notation is a term that is used to define how long an algorithm takes. The more squares or the more bigger the Big O NOtation gets, the longer the algorithm takes. O(1) is the fastest time as it takes only 1 calculation. The Square root of O which is O(âˆšN) or logorithm is also really fast as it takes the square root amount of times to get to the anwer. Linear O which is just O(N) takes longer when there is a bigger N so it gradually gets slower. Then there is the powers which are super slow whcih takes O(N^2) or more. This very slow and takes N Squared the amount of times to get to the answer which means this strategy gets exponetially times slower when N gets larger.
