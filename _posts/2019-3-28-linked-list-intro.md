title: Intro on Linked List
---

Linked List are basically list that you can add and insert to very quickly. Lets take this linked list example into closets.
Imagine if you have closets that can hold only one item each. You would have a 4 closets in a row that have for example your
socks. The next closet is a closet full of deoderant. Then the next closet is full of socks. You would have no space to join 
4 row closet full of socks with the isolated closet full of socks unless you would have more room and you can move the
deoderant closet to the side and attatch the sock full closet to the other sock full closets. Unfortunately, you don't have 
that much space to do this. What you can do now instead is you can make a linked list so you can make a pointer that connects
the sock full drawer to the others like a thread of string and in programming, "insert" the head or the isolated closet into
the original list or the 4 sock filled closets. This would be the most efficient and reliable way to add when you have a full
space which is often the case when you have a computer because the computer is often full of other data. In this closet example,
find would be to find the closet you need to search for. Imagine you labeled your closets from an index 1, 5. You would be able
to find the third closet instantly if they are in order instantly. That's an O(1) operation. Printing this would be printing the
"value" or thing in the closets for this example, I would be printing "socks" because that is whats inside closet 3. Insert like
I said earlier is like connecting a stread of string to the place when you would want to insert it and the thread of string is 
usually two strings, the closet before and after unless you are in the tail of the string or the head. That is basically what 
Linked List are in a closet example.
