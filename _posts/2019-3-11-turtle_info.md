title: Info About Turtles
---

Turtles are a cold blooded reptile with a unique trait, a hard shell that is attatched on it's back. They swim underwater and many people thing it's underside is not hard but it is also hard and is part of the shell called a plastron. Remember plastron, the shell on the belly and the carapace, the shell on the back. They are often confused of tortises which are very similar except they are land animals and have a different type of leg which is not used for swimming in the water but more used to walking on land. Turtles are constantly being endangered by threats of ocean pollution like they confused plastic bags to their favorite treat, a yummy jellyfish. They get stuck in fishing nets and get tangled in rope. Many species of the turtle species are constantly being endangered and the population of turtles in the world are decreasing and you can stop this by limiting the use of pollution and littering.
